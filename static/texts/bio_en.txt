I am a researcher with focus on Bioinformatics, Public Health, and Digital Epidemiology. I hold a PhD in Pathophysiology from the University of São Paulo, and I love developing innovative tools for Health Sciences, Bioinformatics, and Academia. I currently provide independent expertise in epidemiological data analysis and technological development for public health projects at Instituto Todas Pelas Saúde (ITpS) in São Paulo, Brazil.

I’ll be sharing updates about my work here, and I’m excited to collaborate, share ideas, and have some fun along the way!
