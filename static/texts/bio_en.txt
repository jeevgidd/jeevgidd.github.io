I am a researcher with a focus on Bioinformatics, Public Health, and Digital Epidemiology. I hold a PhD in Pathophysiology from the University of SÃ£o Paulo. I enjoy developing innovative tools for Health Sciences, Bioinformatics, and Academia. Currently, I am a visiting researcher at the Computational Systems Biology Lab - CSBL at the Albert Einstein Israelite Institute of Education and Research, Brazil.

I will share my work updates here on this site. Let's collaborate, share ideas, and have some fun along the way!
