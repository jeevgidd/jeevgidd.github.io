I'm a researcher with focus on Bioinformatics, Public Health, and Digital Epidemiology. I hold a PhD in Pathophysiology from the University of São Paulo, and I love developing innovative tools for Health Sciences, Bioinformatics, and Academia. Currently, I'm a visiting researcher at the Computational Systems Biology Laboratory (CSBL) at the Albert Einstein Israelite Institute of Education and Research in São Paulo, Brazil.

I’ll be sharing updates about my work here, and I’m excited to collaborate, share ideas, and have some fun along the way!
